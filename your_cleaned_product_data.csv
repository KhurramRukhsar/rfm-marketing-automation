As soon as Sarsabz Urea dissolves in the soil, it forms around it a zoning layer of high pH and ammonia concentration turning the soil to be acidic and toxic at the same level. Sarsabz Urea is available as prills that are crystalline white and highly resistant to moisture and thus facilitate long time storage.  Sarsabz Urea has the highest nitrogen content, equal to 46 percent. This percentage is much higher than other nitrogenous fertilizers available in the market. The nutrient composition rendered by urea enhances the productivity of the soil and enriches its nutrient constituency. Providing each plant with relevant element needed, urea sustains plant life. Sarsabz Urea can be applied in various forms, it can be spread in bulk alone or can also be mixed with other fertilizers before application. When urea is applied on acidic soils of lower pH i.e below 7.0, it should be incorporated into the soil as soon as possible.

In the context of agriculture, DAP is a water-soluble ammonium phosphate derived from the reaction of ammonia and phosphoric acid. It is a highly concentrated phosphatic fertilizer, with 46% P2O5 and 18% nitrogen (N). It is recommended for all crops as a foundational fertilizer to be applied during sowing. This application promotes robust root development and energizes plant processes. DAP boasts excellent solubility, exceeding 90%, making it one of the most soluble phosphatic fertilizers available. This high solubility enables it to be applied through fertigation after planting. Additionally, due to its nitrogen content, DAP tends to have an acidic effect once the nitrification process is complete. In industrial applications, DAP finds utility as a fire retardant in commercial firefighting products. It also serves other purposes, such as a metal finisher, yeast nutrient, and a sugar purifier.

Once applied to the soil onion crops, Sarsabz Urea undergoes vital transformations and breaks up into ammonium form and this total process is dependent on soil moisture. As soon as Sarsabz Urea dissolves in the soil, it forms around it a zoning layer of high pH and ammonia concentration turning the soil to be acidic and toxic at the same level. Sarsabz Urea is available as prills that are crystalline white and highly resistant to moisture and thus facilitate long time storage.  Sarsabz Urea has the highest nitrogen content, equal to 46 percent. This percentage is much higher than other nitrogenous fertilizers available in the market. The nutrient composition rendered by urea enhances the productivity of the soil and enriches its nutrient constituency. Providing each plant with relevant element needed, urea sustains plant life. Sarsabz Urea can be applied in various forms, it can be spread in bulk alone or can also be mixed with other fertilizers before application. When urea is applied on acidic soils of lower pH i.e below 7.0, it should be incorporated into the soil as soon as possible.

In the context of agriculture, DAP is a water-soluble ammonium phosphate derived from the reaction of ammonia and phosphoric acid. It is a highly concentrated phosphatic fertilizer, with 46% P2O5 and 18% nitrogen (N). It is recommended for all crops as a foundational fertilizer to be applied during sowing. This application promotes robust root development and energizes plant processes. DAP boasts excellent solubility, exceeding 90%, making it one of the most soluble phosphatic fertilizers available. This high solubility enables it to be applied through fertigation after planting. Additionally, due to its nitrogen content, DAP tends to have an acidic effect once the nitrification process is complete. In industrial applications, DAP finds utility as a fire retardant in commercial firefighting products. It also serves other purposes, such as a metal finisher, yeast nutrient, and a sugar purifier.

In the context of agriculture, DAP is a water-soluble ammonium phosphate derived from the reaction of ammonia and phosphoric acid. It is a highly concentrated phosphatic fertilizer, with 46% P2O5 and 18% nitrogen (N). It is recommended for all crops as a foundational fertilizer to be applied during sowing. This application promotes robust root development and energizes plant processes. DAP boasts excellent solubility, exceeding 90%, making it one of the most soluble phosphatic fertilizers available. This high solubility enables it to be applied through fertigation after planting. Additionally, due to its nitrogen content, DAP tends to have an acidic effect once the nitrification process is complete. In industrial applications, DAP finds utility as a fire retardant in commercial firefighting products. It also serves other purposes, such as a metal finisher, yeast nutrient, and a sugar purifier.

The nutrient composition rendered by urea enhances the productivity of the soil and enriches its nutrient constituency. Providing each plant with relevant element needed, urea sustains plant life. Sarsabz Urea can be applied in various forms, it can be spread in bulk alone or can also be mixed with other fertilizers before application. When urea is applied on acidic soils of lower pH i.e below 7.0, it should be incorporated into the soil as soon as possible.

Sarsabz Urea is available as prills that are crystalline white and highly resistant to moisture and thus facilitate long time storage.  Sarsabz Urea has the highest nitrogen content, equal to 46 percent. This percentage is much higher than other nitrogenous fertilizers available in the market. The nutrient composition rendered by urea enhances the productivity of the soil and enriches its nutrient constituency. Providing each plant with relevant element needed, urea sustains plant life. Sarsabz Urea can be applied in various forms, it can be spread in bulk alone or can also be mixed with other fertilizers before application. When urea is applied on acidic soils of lower pH i.e below 7.0, it should be incorporated into the soil as soon as possible.

This percentage is much higher than other nitrogenous fertilizers available in the market. The nutrient composition rendered by urea enhances the productivity of the soil and enriches its nutrient constituency. Providing each plant with relevant element needed, urea sustains plant life. Sarsabz Urea can be applied in various forms, it can be spread in bulk alone or can also be mixed with other fertilizers before application. When urea is applied on acidic soils of lower pH i.e below 7.0, it should be incorporated into the soil as soon as possible.
